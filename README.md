<h2>üßê Features:</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Context API: The Context API is a way to share data across the component tree without explicitly passing props at every level. It allows developers to create a global state that can be accessed by any component within the tree.Using the Context API eliminates the need for "prop drilling," making the data flow more efficient and organized.
- React Router: React Router is a popular library used for handling navigation in React applications. It allows developers to create multiple routes, enabling users to navigate between different pages or views in a single-page application. With React Router, developers can implement dynamic and client-side routing, providing a seamless user experience.
- Lazy Loading :Lazy loading is a method used to defer the loading of non-essential resources until they are needed. In React, components can be lazy-loaded using the React.lazy function and Suspense component. Lazy loading reduces the initial bundle size, resulting in faster load times for the initial page.
- Hot Reloading: React Native introduces the concept of ‚ÄúHot Reloading‚Äù allowing developers to see the immediate results of the code changes without restarting the entire application. This feature accelerates the development process by providing a faster feedback loop enhancing productivity and enabling developers to iterate quickly.
- Reusable Components: React Native promotes the concept of reusable components enabling developers to build modular and scalable applications. Components can be easily reused across different parts of the app or even in entirely different projects. This not only streamlines development but also ensures consistency in design and functionality.
- React Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, React Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks, such as useState and useEffect, enable functional components to have stateful logic and side effects. Hooks make code more concise and readable, and they provide an elegant solution for managing state in functional components.
